# Inter-LPCM
This repository contains the official research code for a learning-based point cloud compression framework. The proposed system integrates point cloud registration, deep neural networks, and entropy coding to efficiently compress 3D point clouds. The code is intended for testing and experimental evaluation purposes only.
